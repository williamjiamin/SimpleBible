    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>
    <span class="badge">SimpleBible for iOS</span>

    <p>SimpleBible ("the App") is developed by Lipai Wang. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and which third parties receive data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
    <p>SimpleBible is designed with privacy at its core. We do <strong>not</strong> directly collect, store on our servers, or sell personal data such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Contacts or address book data</li>
        <li>Health or fitness data</li>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>Your Bible reading history, bookmarks, notes, and settings (these stay on your device only)</li>
        <li>AI Guide conversations (processed on-device, not sent to third-party AI services)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. On-Device Processing</h2>
    <p>The following features process content on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bible Text</strong> — KJV text is bundled in the app and readable offline.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Bible Guide</strong> — Uses Apple's on-device Foundation Models on supported devices. Prompts and responses are not sent to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or other third-party AI inference services.</li>
        <li><strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> — Apple TTS and Kokoro Neural Voice run locally on-device (Kokoro requires model download first).</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic Search</strong> — Search indexing and queries are processed on-device.</li>
        <li><strong>Speech Recognition</strong> — Voice input for Speak &amp; Listen uses Apple's Speech framework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can delete all AI Guide chat history at any time from Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Delete All Chat History.</p>
    <p><strong>Availability note:</strong> AI Guide requires iOS 26 or later and Apple Intelligence compatible hardware. On unsupported devices, AI Guide is unavailable.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Collected by Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The free tier of SimpleBible displays ads from <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect data as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Ad and product interaction data</li>
        <li>Diagnostics such as crash and performance data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used for third-party advertising and analytics. We do not declare cross-app tracking in App Store Connect, and the app does not present an App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt.</p>
    <p>If you purchase <strong>SimpleBible Premium</strong>, all advertisements are permanently removed and no ad-related data is collected.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>SimpleBible offers one-time non-consumable in-app purchases processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment card data. Transaction and billing records are processed by Apple as described in <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Preferences and reading data (theme, font size, bookmarks, favorites, reading progress, and local chat history) are stored locally on your device using iOS storage APIs. This data may be included in your personal iCloud/iTunes backups if enabled on your device.</p>

    <h2>6. Microphone &amp; Speech Recognition</h2>
    <p>The app requests microphone and speech recognition permissions only for Speak &amp; Listen mode. Audio is used to transcribe your spoken query on-device; we do not upload raw recordings to our own servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SimpleBible does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The App's content (the Bible) is suitable for all ages.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>SimpleBible uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> for free-tier banner ads and ad-related analytics</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub (raw content hosting)</strong> only when a user explicitly downloads optional Kokoro voice model files</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No third-party AI inference service is used for AI Guide responses. AI Guide processing is on-device only.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
